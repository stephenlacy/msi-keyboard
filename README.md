keyboard.color('left', {
    color: 'red',
	intensity: 'high'
});

// Set middle region to green default high intensity
keyboard.color('middle', 'green');


// Set right region to blue with light intensity
keyboard.color('right', {
	color: 'blue',
	intensity: 'light',
});


// Hardware modes
// Setting .color() will Not affect the hardware defined colors for modes

// Set Hardware mode to breath
keyboard.mode('breathe');


// Blinking
// Set the keyboard.color() Before calling .blink()
// Refer to examples/blinkMulti.js

// Blink all the keyboard LEDs to 750ms
keyboard.blink(750);


// Blink Only left and right regions at 750ms
keyboard.blink(['left','right'], 750);


// Use the default blink, time: 1000ms
keyboard.blink();


// Stop the blink after 5000ms
setTimeout(keyboard.stopBlink, 5000);

```



## Colors
`keyboard.colors(String region, String Color);`

Colors must be set before using keyboard.blink();

They will not affect hardware-default modes such as Wave and Breathing.

The following colors are defined:

	off
	red
	orange
	yellow
	green
	sky
	blue
	purple
	white

To set a color use keyboard.colors() There are two ways to set the color to a region:
```javascript
keyboard.color('middle', 'green');
keyboard.color('middle', {color:'green', intensity:'high'});
```


## Intensity
`keyboard.colors(String region, {String color, String intensity});`

The color intensity to white can be set via keyboard.colors();

The following intensities are used:

    light
    low
    med
    high
    
To set it:

```javascript
keyboard.color('right', {
    color: 'blue',
	intensity: 'med',  // light, low, med, high
});
```

##Modes
`keyboard.mode(String mode);`

MSI Steelseries keyboards have built in modes, with pre-defined colors.

The colors can not be altered via keyboard.colors();

The modes defined by the hardware are:

    Normal
    Gaming
    Breathe
    Demo
    Wave


Usage:

```javascript

keyboard.mode('wave');

```


##Regions
`keyboard.colors(String region, String color);`

There are three regions on the Steelseries keyboard:

    Left
    Middle
    Right

Each can have a color and intensity set.



##Blink
`keyboard.blink(Time milliseconds);`

The time is the speed in which the keyboard is to blink.

keyboard.colors(); Must be set before using keyboard.blink();

Usage:

```javascript
// keyboard.color(...);


keyboard.blink(750);
```

To blink one, or two regions only:

```javascript
// keyboard.color(...);


keyboard.blink(['left','right'], 750);
```



## Examples
